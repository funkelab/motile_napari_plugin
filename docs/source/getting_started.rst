Getting started with the motile plugin
======================================

Installation
************
This plugin depends on ``ilpy``, which must be installed via conda.::

    conda create -n motile-plugin python=3.10
    conda activate motile-plugin
    conda install -c conda-forge -c funkelab -c gurobi ilpy
    pip install motile-plugin

If this is successful, you can then run ``napari`` from your command line, and
the motile plugin should be visible in the ``Plugins`` drop down menu.
Clicking this should open the motile widget on the right of the viewer.

Tutorial video
**************
This video walks through tracking an example dataset from the `Cell Tracking Challenge`_,
covering most of the same information as the rest of this getting started guide.

Input data
**********
The motile plugin does not perform detection: you must provide a Labels layer or a Points layer
containing the objects you want to track.
The Labels layer must have time as the
first dimension followed by the spatial dimensions (no channels).
You can load an example Labels layer of a 2D HeLa dataset from the `Cell Tracking Challenge`_
in ``Files`` -> ``Sample Data`` -> ``Fluo-N2DL-HeLa (Motile)``.
The Points layer must have the point locations with time as the first number,
followed by the spatial dimensions. While source images are
nice to qualitatively evaluate results, they are not necessary to run tracking.

In the future, we could also support Shapes layers as input (for example,
for bounding box tracking) - please react to
`Issue #48`_ if this is important to your use case, and give feedback on what type
of shape linking you want.

Plugin widgets
**************
You can open the Main Motile Widget via ``Plugins`` -> ``Motile`` -> ``Motile Main Widget``.
This will open a tab widget containing a ``Motile``, ``Edit Tracks``, and ``Results List`` widget, as well
as an empty ``Lineage View`` widget at the bottom of the screen. Alternatively, you can open the Tree View
and the Menus widgets individually under ``Plugins`` -> ``Motile`` and dock them manually.

Running tracking
****************
The ``Motile`` tab by default opens to the ``Run Editor`` view. In this view,
you can pick a name for your run, select an input layer, set
hyperparameters, and start a motile run. Hovering over the title of each
element in the widget will make a tooltip appear describing the purpose
of the element. All hyperparameters are explained in more detail below.
When you are ready, click the ``Run Tracking`` button to start tracking.

Hyperparameters
---------------
The hyperparameters set up constraints on the optimization problem.
These constraints will never be violated by the solution.

- ``Max Move Distance`` - The maximum distance an object center can move between time frames, in scaled units. This should be an upper bound, as nothing further will be connected.
- ``Max Children`` - The maximum number of objects in the next time frames that an object can be linked to. Set this to 1 for tracking problems without divisions.

Constant Costs
--------------
The constant costs contribute to the objective function that the optimization
problem will minimize. They are the same for all possible links in the
tracking problem, and should be set based on general properties of the problem.
Unchecking the checkbox will not include the cost in the objective at all,
while changing the weight values will change how much each cost contributes
to the objective.

- ``Edge Selection`` - A cost for linking any two objects between time frames. If you do not have many false positive detections, this value should be quite negative to encourage selecting as many linking edges as possible. If none of your costs are negative, the objective function will be minimized by selecting nothing (which has cost 0), so this cost can control generally how many edges/links are selected.
- ``Appear`` - A cost for starting a new track. Assuming tracks should be long and continuous, the appear cost should be positive. A high appear cost encourages continuing tracks where possible, but can lead to not selecting short tracks at all.
- ``Division`` - A cost for dividing, where a higher division cost will lead to fewer divisions. If your task does not have divisions, this cost does not matter - you can un-check it for clarity, but including it will do nothing.

Attribute weights
-----------------
The attribute-based costs also contribute to the objective function that
the optimizer will minimize. Every possible link in the tracking problem
will have a different cost based on the specific attributes (distance or IoU)
of that pair of detections. Unchecking the checkbox will not include the
feature in the objective. The user-provided weight values will be multiplied by
the attribute values to generate the cost for linking a specific pair of
detections.

- ``Distance`` - Use the distance between objects as a feature for linking. The provided weight will be multiplied by the distance between objects to get the cost for linking the two objects. This weight should usually be positive, so that higher distances are more costly.
- ``IoU`` - Use the Intersection over Union between objects as a feature for linking. This option only applies if your input is a segmentation. The provided weights will be multiplied by the IoU to get the cost for linking two objects. This weight should usually be negative, so that higher IoUs are more likely to be linked.


Viewing run results
*******************
Clicking the ``Run Tracking`` button will automatically take you to the ``Run Viewer``.
It contains the following:

- The ``Solver status`` label, which will display if the solver is in progress or
  done solving.
- The ``Graph of solver gap``, which is mostly for debugging purposes.
  The solver gap is an optimization value that should decrease at each iteration.
- The run settings, including ``Hyperparameters``, ``Costs``, and ``Attribute weights``.
- The ``Save run`` button. This button will take you to a file dialog to save the
  whole run, so that if you close napari and re-open it, you can load the run
  and see the results.
- The ``Export tracks to CSV`` button, which will take you to a file dialog for saving
  a csv file containing the tracks. If your input was a Labels layer, the
  ``node_id`` will be determined by the time and the original segmentation label id.
  If your input was a Points layer, the ``node_id`` is simply the index of the
  node in the list of points.
    - Note: This does not save the output segmentation. If you want to save
    the relabeled segmentation, you can do so through napari by selecting the
    layer and then selecting ``File``-> ``Save selected layers``
- The ``Back to editing`` button, which will return you to the ``Run Editor`` in its
  previous state.
- The ``Edit this run`` button. This button will take you back to the ``Run Editor``,
  but will overwrite the previous settings with the settings of the run you are
  viewing.

Once the solver completes, you will also see a tracks layer
in the napari viewer. If your input was a segmentation, there will also be
a new segmentation layer where the IDs have been relabeled to match across time.

Each ``Tracking Run`` will be stored in the ``Results List`` widget.
These are the runs that are stored in memory - if you run tracking multiple
times with different inputs or parameters, you can click back and forth
between the results here. Here you can also save any runs that you want to store for later.
Deleting runs you do not want to keep viewing is a good idea, since these are stored in memory.
Runs that were saved in previous sessions do not appear here until you load them from disk with the
``Load Tracks`` button.

For details on viewing the tracking results in the lineage tree, go to the :doc:`Tree View <tree_view>` documentation.
