        graph: dict {int: list}
            Graph representing associations between tracks. Dictionary defines the
            mapping between a track ID and the parents of the track. This can be
            one (the track has one parent, and the parent has >=1 child) in the
            case of track splitting, or more than one (the track has multiple
            parents, but only one child) in the case of track merging.
