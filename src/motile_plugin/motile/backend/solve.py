    """Get a tracking solution for the given segmentation and parameters.

    Constructs a candidate graph from the segmentation, a solver from
    the parameters, and then runs solving and returns a networkx graph
    with the solution. Most of this functionality is implemented in the
    motile toolbox.

    Args:
        solver_params (SolverParams): The solver parameters to use when
            initializing the solver
        input_data (np.ndarray): The input segmentation or points list to run
            tracking on. If 2D, assumed to be a list of points, otherwise a
            segmentation.
        on_solver_update (Callable, optional): A function that is called
            whenever the motile solver emits an event. The function should take
            a dictionary of event data, and can be used to track progress of
            the solver. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        nx.DiGraph: A solution graph where the ids of the nodes correspond to
            the time and ids of the passed in segmentation labels. See the
            motile_toolbox for exact implementation details.
