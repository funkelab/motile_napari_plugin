    Attributes:
        graph (nx.DiGraph): A graph with nodes representing detections and
            and edges representing links across time. Assumed to be "valid"
            tracks (e.g., this is not supposed to be a candidate graph),
            but the structure is not verified.
        segmentation (Optional(np.ndarray)): An optional segmentation that
            accompanies the tracking graph. If a segmentation is provided,
            it is assumed that the graph has an attribute (default
            "seg_id") holding the segmentation id. Defaults to None.
        time_attr (str): The attribute in the graph that specifies the time
            frame each node is in.
        pos_attr (str | tuple[str] | list[str]): The attribute in the graph
            that specifies the position of each node. Can be a single attribute
            that holds a list, or a list of attribute keys.
