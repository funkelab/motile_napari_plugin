"""This module contains all the low level actions used to control a Tracks object.
Low level actions should control these aspects of Tracks:
    - synchronizing segmentation and nodes (including bi-directional access). Currently,
    this means updating the seg_id and time attributes on the node, and updating the
    seg_time_to_node dictionary.
    - Updating attributes that are controlled by the segmentation. Currently, position
    and area for nodes, and IOU for edges.
    - Keeping track of information needed to undo the given action. For removing a node,
    this means keeping track of the incident edges that were removed, along with their
    attributes.

The low level actions do not contain application logic, such as manipulating track ids,
or validation of "allowed" actions.
The actions should work on candidate graphs as well as solution graphs.
Action groups can be constructed to represent application-level actions constructed
from many low-level actions.
